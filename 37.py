#dictionary in python
"""
A dictionary is a built-in data type in python that stores data in key-value
pairs. It is similar to a real-world dictionary, where you look up a word(key)
to find its meaning(value)

#key must be unique and immutable(string, number, tuple)
#value can be of any data type and can be duplicated
#Dictionary is unordered(before python 3.7), but from python 3.7+
it maintains interior order.
